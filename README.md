# Machine Learning Project Proposal: Pokemon Tier List
Team Members: Andrew Harper, Brighan Schwind, Trevor Pike, and Rahil Patel
## Summary
The main point of this project is to classify an entered pokemon's effectiveness in battle in a tier list fashion. The list would be based on what stats (Def,Hp,PP,Atk,Sp.Atk,Def,Sp.Def) that pokemon has above an average. Our tiers/class will be 3: Above Average Pokemons, Average Pokemons, Bad Pokemons.
## Why it's doable
This project is doable because we are able to classify pokemons into tiers by looking at the sum of the stats. Additionally, the pokemon data is available from kaggle so we are able to gather the data easily.
## Data Source 
The Data Source can be found on kaggle.

## Purpose
The purpose is to classify the usefulness of new pokemon that may be added in future generations. This could be used to balance out the distribution of pokemons by balancing out the tiers. Application: if there are a lot of pokemons in the Above Average tier, then the pokemon company can look at the classifier and try to decrease some of the pokemon stats so there are more pokemons in the Average tier. We should be able to input a certain pokemon and figure out which class it's close to so we can know if that certain pokemon is an above average, average, or bad pokemon.
